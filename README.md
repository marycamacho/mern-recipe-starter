# mern-recipe-starter
Personal web app starter with mongo, node+express, react, redux and several other react libraries.

Instructions:

Ensure mongo server is installed locally.


Notes:

Eventually want to have this include a git command for pulling without creating a repo so that it can be used to locally to push and create a new master app repo.

Create Notes:

Packages.json

include start and prestart scripts
ensure mongo node driver is in packages or instructures
ensure file structure and sample files included have app work with router
