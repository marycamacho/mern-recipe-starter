# mern-recipe-starter
Personal web app starter with mongo, node+express, react, redux and several other react libraries.

This is intended for me to use to kickstart MERN projects with webpack as the primary processing tool.

Instructions:

1. Ensure mongo server is installed locally.
2. Create local directory or git repo with read me and clone to local.
3. If this repo is cloned on local - just copy all files to the new repo and push/create in master.
4. Edit the mongo-connection.js file with correct URL
5. Update packages.json with correct name, license, version, repo, issues URL, etc.


Notes:

Eventually want to have this include a git command for pulling without creating a repo so that it can be used to locally to push and create a new master app repo.

Create Notes:

* Packages.json
* setup for npm install
* include start and prestart scripts
* ensure mongo node driver is in packages or instructures
* ensure file structure and sample files included have app work with router
* ensure has login 
* include ignore file and config
