# mern-recipe-starter
Personal web app starter with mongo, node+express, react, redux and several other react libraries.

This is intended for me to use to kickstart MERN projects with webpack as the primary processing tool.

Instructions:

*Ensure mongo server is installed locally.
*Create local directory or git repo with read me and clone to local.
*If this repo is cloned on local - just copy all files to the new repo and push/create in master.


Notes:

Eventually want to have this include a git command for pulling without creating a repo so that it can be used to locally to push and create a new master app repo.

Create Notes:

Packages.json
setup for npm install
include start and prestart scripts
ensure mongo node driver is in packages or instructures
ensure file structure and sample files included have app work with router
ensure has login 
include ignore file and config
